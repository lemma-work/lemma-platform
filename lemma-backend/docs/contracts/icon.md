# icon contract

What every `icon` API operation guarantees: who may call it, what must be true first, what changes, what it emits, and how it refuses.

The product promises these serve are in [the product specification](../../../docs/product/README.md). This says what each operation does; that says what any of it is for.

The table below is generated from the committed OpenAPI specification by `scripts/check_contracts.py --write`. Add the behaviour in prose under each operation's heading, outside the generated block — that part is preserved across regeneration.

<!-- generated:operations -- do not edit below -->

| Operation | Method | Path | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `icon.public.get` | GET | `/public/icons/{icon_path}` | Get Public Icon |
| `icon.upload` | POST | `/icons/upload` | Upload Icon |
